- release manifest checked
- exported artifact path checked
- route and asset validation performed
- Lighthouse config and command used
- exact categories and thresholds enforced

## Findings

List findings first, highest severity first.

If there are no findings, say exactly: `No blocking findings.`

## Assumptions

## Decision

State one explicit outcome:

- Approved for publish
- Changes requested before publish
- Blocked

## Required Follow-ups

List any remaining publish or documentation actions.

## Lighthouse Evidence

Record the deterministic Lighthouse evidence here:

- exported artifact path
- local or CI server command used to serve `out/`
- config file used
- categories gated
- thresholds used
- summary of pass or fail result
