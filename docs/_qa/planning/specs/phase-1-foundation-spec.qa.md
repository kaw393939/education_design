# Phase 1 Foundation Spec QA

## Scope

Review the active phase-1 foundation spec for architectural clarity, process fit, and implementation readiness.

## Method

Reviewed the current source-of-truth spec against the active supporting contracts:

- `docs/_specs/README.md`
- `docs/_specs/educational-design-system/operating-runbook.md`
- `docs/_specs/educational-design-system/planning-qa-spec.md`
- `docs/_specs/educational-design-system/deployment.md`

Checked for:

- clear purpose and scope boundaries
- alignment with the repaired content and workflow model
- explicit QA and deployment expectations
- absence of stale authority conflicts

## Findings

No blocking findings.

## Assumptions

- The repo remains documentation-first until the implementation scaffold is created.
- Later implementation work will introduce the actual Next.js app, CI workflow, and Lighthouse configuration described by the active specs.

## Decision

Approved as the active planning foundation for phase 1.

## Required Follow-ups

- Maintain this QA artifact if the foundation spec changes materially.
- Create corresponding implementation and release QA artifacts only when actual implementation work exists.
