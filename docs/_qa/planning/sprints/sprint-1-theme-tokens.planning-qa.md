# Sprint 1 Theme Tokens Planning QA

## Scope

Review the Sprint 1 brief to confirm it is bounded, testable, and ready to guide implementation.

## Method

Reviewed the sprint brief against:

- the phase-1 foundation spec
- the operating runbook
- the deployment and export constraints
- the quality-gate expectations for accessibility and deterministic verification

Checked for:

- semantic token scope rather than page-specific styling
- accessibility and reduced-motion coverage
- export-safe expectations
- clear exit criteria for a first implementation sprint

## Findings

No blocking findings.

## Assumptions

- Sprint 1 implementation will happen after a real app scaffold exists.
- The implementation will treat token naming, contrast, and reading-width behavior as system contracts rather than one-page tuning.

## Decision

Approved for implementation.

## Required Follow-ups

- Create `sprint-1-theme-tokens.implementation-qa.md` when implementation begins.
- Record actual accessibility and exported-build evidence in the implementation QA artifact rather than in this planning record.
