# Educational Design System Component Inventory

## Purpose

This document maps the museum site's component families to their educational design system equivalents and defines the target phase-1 component contracts.

The inventory has three jobs:

1. Classify what is reusable versus topic-bound.
2. Name the new first-class educational primitives.
3. Define enough contract detail for sprint implementation and testing.

For phase 1, the primitives in this file are render targets. Authors and agents should not assemble pages by manually composing primitives. Instead, page-level units should render through an ordered `blocks[]` contract defined in the content schema.

## Abstraction map from the museum site

| Source family | Status | Phase 1 target | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chapter-hero.tsx` | Generalize | `LessonHero` | Strong orientation pattern, but chapter framing is topic-specific |
| `chapter-section.tsx` | Generalize | `SectionBlock` | Good structural wrapper for labeled explanation sections |
| `chapter-timeline.tsx` | Generalize | `SequenceTimeline` | Sequence pattern is reusable beyond history |
| `chapter-visual-break.tsx` | Keep and generalize | `VisualBreak` | Useful pacing and narrative reset primitive |
| `editorial-aside.tsx` | Keep and generalize | `EditorialAside` | Supports annotation and contextual support |
| `pull-quote.tsx` | Generalize | `PullInsight` | Quote pattern should become evidence or insight oriented |
| `transition-block.tsx` | Generalize | `NextStepBlock` | Strong navigation and sequencing behavior |
| `editorial-card-grid.tsx` | Generalize | `ConceptGrid` | Good for concept summaries and modular overviews |
| `editorial-summary-grid.tsx` | Generalize | `SummaryGrid` | Strong recap pattern |
| `guide-callout.tsx` | Split and generalize | `WhyItMatters`, `WorkedExample` | Current callout role is overloaded |
| `reading-cluster-grid.tsx` | Generalize | `ReadingMapGrid` | Useful for curated resource navigation |
| `narrative-card-grid.tsx` | Defer | `ProfileGrid` later | Valuable, but not essential for phase 1 baseline |
| `historical-anchor-grid` concept | Rename and generalize | `SourceAnchorGrid` | Source and proof blocks are reusable; historical naming is not |
| `math-block.tsx` | Defer | `FormulaBlock` later | Useful for some disciplines, not part of baseline minimum |
| home-specific sections | Decompose | Recipe parts, not primitives | These are page compositions, not reusable primitives |

## Phase-1 block render contracts

| Block type | Render target | Minimum payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hero` | `LessonHero` | `title`, `dek` |
| `whyItMatters` | `WhyItMatters` | `summary`, `stakes` |
| `section` | `SectionBlock` | `title`, `body` |
| `conceptGrid` | `ConceptGrid` | `items[]` |
| `summaryGrid` | `SummaryGrid` | `items[]` |
| `comparisonGrid` | `ComparisonGrid` | `columns`, `rows` |
| `sequenceTimeline` | `SequenceTimeline` | `mode`, `items[]` |
| `workedExample` | `WorkedExample` | `prompt`, `steps[]` |
| `editorialAside` | `EditorialAside` | `body` |
| `pullInsight` | `PullInsight` | `quote` |
| `visualBreak` | `VisualBreak` | `title` or `body` or `visualRef` |
| `reflectionPrompt` | `ReflectionPrompt` | `prompt` |
| `nextStep` | `NextStepBlock` | `title`, `primaryAction` |
| `sourceAnchorGrid` | `SourceAnchorGrid` | `items[]` |
| `glossary` | `GlossaryBlock` | `terms[]` |
| `readingMapGrid` | `ReadingMapGrid` | `clusters[]` |

These block contracts are the bridge between the content schema and the component layer. If a page cannot be expressed through this block set, either the recipe is wrong or the system needs a new block type and primitive pair.

## Deferred or removed phase-1 candidates

| Candidate | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ProfileGrid` | Defer | Useful for biography-heavy experiences, not required for the baseline |
| `FormulaBlock` | Defer | Important for STEM-specific sites but not universal enough for phase 1 |
| Home-only chronology and scene sections | Do not elevate as primitives | They belong inside recipes, not the primitive layer |
| Topic-specific narrative cards | Rename or remove | They should return only if a later recipe truly needs them |

## Testing expectations for this inventory

1. Every phase-1 educational primitive needs at least one unit test.
2. Layout primitives need responsive and semantic smoke coverage.
3. Components that affect sequencing or navigation need explicit keyboard and focus checks.
4. Placeholder content must prove the components work outside AI-history subject matter.
5. Block-to-component mappings should be validated so recipe rendering does not depend on page-specific glue code.
